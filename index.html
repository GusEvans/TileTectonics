	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>This program is a basic plate tectonics simulator. You can generate a new planet 
	with neat rectangular plates, and watch as those plates change shape through 
	interactions resembling those found in real life. Try generating a map and clicking
	the 'Move and Resolve' button a few times to see what happens!</p>
	<h3>How it works</h3>
	<p>When you generate a map, what you see is a grid of tiles. Tiles within a black 
	outlined region belong to a single tectonic plate, and move together around the map.
	Plates that are green, yellow, or orange are continental, while plates that are blue,
	purple, or pink are oceanic. Note that the tile grid wraps around on itself, so tiles
	on the left edge share a border with tiles on the right edge, and tiles on the top
	row are next to those on the bottom row.</p>
	<p>When you click the 'Move Plates' button, every plate moves in a certain direction
	that is randomly selected when you generate the map. (This direction can change from
	round to round.) However, this will cause plates to overlap, creating a convergent
	boundary, which is indicated by the tiles in conflict turning red. It will also cause
	gaps to appear between plates, creating a divergent boundary, which is indicated by
	the empty tiles turning grey. In real life, there are no gaps between tectonic plates,
	so these conflicts and empty tiles need to be resolved.</p>
	<p>Clicking the 'Resolve Tiles' button will resolve these conflicts and empty tiles
	following a set of predictable rules. Tiles will try to join the neighboring plate
	with the most tiles around that tile. If there's a tie, tiles in conflict will
	preference continental plates over oceanic plates, while empty tiles will preference
	oceanic plates over continental plates. This is because oceanic plates tend to subduct
	under thicker continental plates when they converge, and oceanic plates tend to expand 
	when they diverge through the process of seafloor spreading.</p>
	<p>The standard way to interact with this program is alternate between clicking 'Move
	Plates' and 'Allocate Tiles' to see what happens in every round of the simulation.
	But you can speed up the process by clicking the 'Move and Resolve' button, which will
	do both actions at once. Repeatedly clicking 'Move and Resolve' will effectively
	animate the simulation, and the results can be quite pretty.</p>
	<p>This simulation is in no way accurate, as the plates tend to reach an equilibrium
	after a while, which doesn't happen in real life. In addition, transform faults aren't
	modeled at all, and plates can easily disappear from the map. But it does show some of
	the basic interactions of plate tectonics.</p>
