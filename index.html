	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>This program is a basic plate tectonics simulator. You can generate a new planet 
	with neat rectangular plates, and watch as those plates change shape through 
	interactions resembling those found in real life. Try generating a map and clicking
	the 'Move and resolve' button a few times to see what happens!</p>
	<h3>How it works</h3>
	<p>When you generate a map, what you see is a grid of tiles. Tiles within a black 
	outlined region belong to a single tectonic plate, and move together around the map.
	Plates that are green, yellow, or orange are continental, while plates that are blue,
	purple, or pink are oceanic. Note that the tile grid wraps around on itself, so tiles
	on the left edge share a border with tiles on the right edge, and tiles on the top
	row are next to those on the bottom row.</p>
	<p>When you click the 'Move plates' button, every plate moves in a certain direction
	that is randomly selected when you generate the map. (This direction can change from
	round to round.) However, this will cause plates to overlap, creating a convergent
	boundary, which is indicated by the tiles in conflict turning red. It will also cause
	gaps to appear between plates, creating a divergent boundary, which is indicated by
	the empty tiles turning grey. In real life, there are no gaps between tectonic plates,
	so these conflicts and empty tiles need to be resolved.</p>
	<p>Clicking the 'Resolve tiles' button will resolve these conflicts and empty tiles
	following a set of predictable rules. Tiles will try to join the neighboring plate
	with the most tiles around that tile. If there's a tie, tiles will check which plates
	are the most prominent in their neighboring tiles and join the smallest one, though
	tiles in conflict will preference continental plates over oceanic plates, while empty
	tiles will preference oceanic plates over continental plates. This is because oceanic
	plates tend to subduct under thicker continental plates when they converge, and 
	oceanic plates tend to expand when they diverge through the process of seafloor
	spreading.</p>
	<p>The standard way to interact with this program is alternate between clicking 'Move
	plates' and 'Resolve tiles' to see what happens in every round of the simulation. But
	you can speed up the process by clicking the 'Move and resolve' button, which will do
	both actions at once. Repeatedly clicking 'Move and resolve' will effectively animate
	the simulation, and the results can look quite cool. (Try to avoid clicking 'Move
	plates' multiple times in a row, as that can make things behave incorrectly.)</p>
	<p>This simulation is in no way realistic, as the plates tend to reach an equilibrium
	after a while, which doesn't happen in real life. In addition, transform faults aren't
	modeled at all, and plates can easily disappear from the map. But it does show some of
	the basic interactions of plate tectonics.</p>
	<h3>Other notes</h3>
	<p>You can use map codes to save plate simulations for viewing again. A map code will
	be generated with each map, and will appear below it. The code starts with the first
	number and ends with the last letter. By clicking the 'Generate from map code' button
	and pasting in the code, a particular map can be simulated exactly the same as it was
	originally. The code consists of numbers for the width and height of the map in tiles,
	the number of columns and rows of plates, and the size of the tiles, followed by
	letters for the type of each plate (continental or oceanic), followed by letters for
	the sequence of directions each plate moves in. By changing these values, it's
	possible to create maps with custom sizes and movement patterns.</p>
